### Select your color

Initially, you'll see four colors available. The black one, and other three random colors.

#### Ok. But if I've found a color that I like, and I don't want to lose it with the refresh?

No problems here too. It's possible to save a specific showed color by double-clicking it, and it will be safe from future refreshs.

Even if you close your section, finish your browser or turn off your computer, your favorite colors will be safe when you back again for Pixels Art.

To unfavorite a color, and make room for new ones, you can use the same way. Double-click on the color, and it will be unfavorited.

### Resize your board

Your board will start with a default size of 5x5. But if I want to increase that, it's possible? Of course!

Select the board length on the input available, lesser or equal than 50, and greater or equal than 5, and click on `VQV` button (it can be fired by `Enter` key too). You'll see the board size change.

<br />

> ‚ö†Ô∏è BEWARE! If you already have any drawing on your board, it will be lost on resizing.

### Save your work

It's so upset when we have done a great work, but we get it lost because we need close our browser or even turn off the computer. But no with Pixels Art.

It's possible to save your work for continue to drawing whenever you want. After you have finished by now, it's just click on `Salvar` button, and your job will be saved on local storage, waiting for you for the next time.

After all, if you want to clear your board, and start a new drawning from beginning, you can click `Limpar` button, and you can start all over again. Awesome!
